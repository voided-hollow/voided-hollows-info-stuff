# V.O.I.D. Protocol  
> Virtual Operations & Information Directive  
> Status: active  
> Node: VOID Network Core  

## Purpose
To maintain clarity, consistency, and security across all nodes in the VOID network,  
ensuring signals are transmitted, received, and archived properly while preserving system integrity.  

## Protocol Nodes

### V – Verify
- Every incoming signal (email, message, submission) must be verified by node integrity.  
- Confirm source authenticity before allowing the signal to propagate.  

### O – Organize
- Signals are routed to the correct node based on category:  
  - Tech → [being made]  
  - Animation → [being made] 
  - Core / unsure where it goes → [being made] 
- Misrouted signals are quarantined until proper classification.  

### I – Integrate
- Verified signals are integrated into the VOID network archive.  
- Data is logged, timestamped, and cross-referenced with relevant nodes.  

### D – Dispatch
- Responses or actions are dispatched according to node purpose:  
  - Tech: troubleshooting, experiments  
  - Animation: collaboration, review, feedback  
  - Core / General: coordination, general inquiries  
- Monitor for anomalies or corrupted signals.  

## Transmission Guidelines
- All communications should be routed through their designated node.  
- Signals outside the protocol may be flagged or delayed until verification.  
- Maintain archival logs of all transmissions for system integrity.
