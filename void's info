Hi, I’m Void a creator drawn to the strange side of technology and the hidden code beneath what most people see.  
I’m interested in video games, game corruptions, and exploring how digital systems behave when they break.  
I enjoy digging into code, learning how games are structured, and uncovering the logic behind their design.  
I’m also fascinated by the hardware side of things — the circuitry, the signals, and the spaces between them.  

I’m currently nothing but I do/will be learning Python, (maybe) C#, and the fundamentals of low-level programming.  
I like understanding how computers think and how errors can reveal more about a system than success ever does.  

I’m looking to collaborate on experimental projects — especially ones that explore game modification,  
analog horror, or interactive digital art. I’m interested in creative coding that feels eerie,  
introspective, or offbeat.  

Pronouns: he/him  
Fun fact: I’m building a YouTube channel focused on computers, game experiments,  
and the beauty of digital decay.
